# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-03)

**Core value:** Verified incidents are visible and actionable within seconds of confirmation — citizens see real-time verified reports on map and feed; admins dispatch responders without delay; push alerts reach affected municipalities immediately.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — domain-model-backend-contracts

## Current Position

Phase: 2
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-03

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 8
- Average duration: ~3 min/plan
- Total execution time: <30 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 8 | 8 | ~3 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: Phase 01 (01-01 through 01-08)
- Trend: Foundation complete — proceeding to Phase 2

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 8 → Phase 9 reorder: Contacts Management must precede Admin Triage because TRI-04 (dispatch) requires CON-01 (existing contacts). SPECS had Triage before Contacts; roadmap corrects this.
- Map stability via sibling layout: Leaflet MapContainer mounted as sibling to drawer (never child) to prevent remount on drawer toggle.
- React-Leaflet Strict Mode guard: MapContainer requires ref guard to prevent double-initialization in React 18 dev Strict Mode.
- Three-tier report split: `reports` (public) / `report_private` (owner+admin) / `report_ops` (admin-only) for field-level privacy.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 9 (Admin Triage) depends on Phase 8 (Contacts) being complete before dispatch workflows can be tested end-to-end.
- Phase 12 (Hardening) App Check enforcement requires 2-week burn-in period after initial deployment — timeline must account for this before production go-live.
