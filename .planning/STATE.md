# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-03)

**Core value:** Verified incidents are visible and actionable within seconds of confirmation — citizens see real-time verified reports on map and feed; admins dispatch responders without delay; push alerts reach affected municipalities immediately.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 (Project Foundation & Tooling)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 8 → Phase 9 reorder: Contacts Management must precede Admin Triage because TRI-04 (dispatch) requires CON-01 (existing contacts). SPECS had Triage before Contacts; roadmap corrects this.
- Map stability via sibling layout: Leaflet MapContainer mounted as sibling to drawer (never child) to prevent remount on drawer toggle.
- React-Leaflet Strict Mode guard: MapContainer requires ref guard to prevent double-initialization in React 18 dev Strict Mode.
- Three-tier report split: `reports` (public) / `report_private` (owner+admin) / `report_ops` (admin-only) for field-level privacy.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 9 (Admin Triage) depends on Phase 8 (Contacts) being complete before dispatch workflows can be tested end-to-end.
- Phase 12 (Hardening) App Check enforcement requires 2-week burn-in period after initial deployment — timeline must account for this before production go-live.
